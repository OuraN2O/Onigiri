Ongiri („ÅäÊè°„Çä), also known as omusubi („Åä„ÇÄ„Åô„Å≥) or rice balls (üçô), is a traditional japanese recipee rich in carbohidrates, which are essential to provide energy, so you can study your Anki cards! 

This is the intention of Onigiri, to give you the proper motivation to study your cards with a beautiful new layout to Anki (ÊöóË®ò), an extra carbohydrate to give you that boost to study. 
</p>

### Philosophy

- **Anki is democratic**: Anki is a tool that is used by everyone, from every corner of the world, every user should have the right to adapt it to their own needs, with the colors and aspects that they want. Onigiri helps Anki become an even more democratic and user-friendly experience. 
- **Great design can motivate**: Motivation can bring more productivity and motivation for students to study, to visit the app more often and be drawn to it. Research has prooved that a well-structured and user-friendly design can, in fact, [cultivate motivation](https://www.mdpi.com/2414-4088/2/1/6).
- **Calm defaults, powerful options**: The base experience stays simple. Advanced controls are discoverable, not overwhelming‚Äîletting users grow into complexity at their pace.
- **Consistency with flexibility**: Users can change the look and feel without breaking core Anki paradigms‚Äîcards, reviews, intervals‚Äîso muscle memory still works.
&nbsp;

### Why Onigiri? 

You may wonder "But Anki works good already, why should I change?". 
I know, Anki works, but Onigiri helps it feel great to use. By refreshing the interface with calm defaults, readable typography, and gentle cues, Onigiri lowers friction and raise motivation ‚Äì¬†so you show up to your cards more often, with more energy.
